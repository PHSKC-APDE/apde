deduplicate_addresses(conn_hhsaw = NULL, conn_phclaims = NULL)
}
\arguments{

\description{
\code{deduplicate_addresses} removes duplicate addresses in the ref tables and synchronize.
}
\details{
This function brings in all addresses currently in the reference tables 
and deduplicates them. Because there is a stage -> final workflow, the stage version 
of each table also needs to be deduplicated. Also, the reference tables are currently
synchronized between two different servers. In order to avoid reintroducing 
duplicates, both servers must be deduplicated (and synchronized at the same time). 
Server and table names are currently hard coded but could be made more generalized if needed.
